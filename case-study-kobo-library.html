              <h3 class="mt-0">Background</h3>
              <p>In my role at Kobo, an eBook company, we wanted to drastically improve our library experience. The existing library was on a legacy system, with a lot of usability issues, and a generally poor experience.
              </p>


              <p><strong>My role:</strong> I was the UX Design Lead, working with a Product Manager, a Visual Designer and a team of Engineers. As this feature was at the core of an eBook company, there were also a lot of stakeholders from across the business.
              </p>

              <h3>Talking to customers</h3>
              <p>Before starting any design, we looked at our data, talked to internal stakeholders, and interviewed customers in person. The majority of our users only had a couple of books in their library. But we also had many power users with 10-15,000 books.
</p>
              <h3>A business opportunity</h3>
              <p>In addition to improving the book management experience, I saw an opportunity to drive sales. Users often downloaded a free preview of books. With the right design, we could convert previews to paid books.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto text-left m-3 text-center">
            <img id="zoom-margin" class="medium-zoom-image" src="img/projects/kobo-library/sketch.jpg" alt="Early stage sketching." />
            <span class="legend">Early stage sketching</span>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto text-left">
              <h3>Designing for both extremes</h3>
              <p>If most of our users only have a few books, we don’t want them to see a bare page. Instead, we wanted to create a rich experience, that re-creates the pride of a real book shelf. For our power users, they were often more interested in scanning & finding books. I designed a condensed list view that shows more metadata, and no images.
              </p>

          </div>

            <div class="col-md-10 mx-auto text-left m-3 text-center">
              <img id="zoom-margin" class="medium-zoom-image" src="img/projects/kobo-library/compare-view.jpg" alt="List and grid view." />
              <span class="legend">A list and a grid view available to all users. The site remembers your preference for future use. (wireframe)</span>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto text-left">
              <h3>Reading list</h3>
              <p>A new concept a the company. I designed an experience that allowed users to create a sequential list of books to read. This helped users remove the friction of finding their next book.
              </p>

                <h3>Easily find books</h3>
                <p>One of the primary goals was to make books easier to find. I designed a tool to refine items in your library, by genre, series and author. Adding a search also gave users easy access to books.
                </p>
            </div>

              <div class="col-md-8 mx-auto text-left">
                <h3>Converting free to paid users</h3>
                <p>
                  Often converting the a new user to be a paying user is the hardest step. I designed an empty state, that offered them a discount on their first book. This is much more satisfying than see a message that says ‘there are no books in your library’.

                <h3>Sharing Insights & Data with users</h3>
                <p>
                  When collecting data, it’s often hard to know what is useful to users, and what is just noise. We showed users their reading history stats, in a fun way that gave a sense of accomplishment. This is turn can act as an incentive to read more, which many people aspire to do.
